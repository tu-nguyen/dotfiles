# dotfiles
My personal configuration files for my personal laptop(.bashrc, .vimrc)

Everyone create little "systems" or ways of doing things, and programmers are the laziest kinds of people on Earth.
Typing up "clear" to clear the terminal? Nah, "c".

## install

Um these are kinda personal and VERY tailored to me but if you want...

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tu-nguyen/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
ln -sv $(pwd)/.bash_extras ~/.bash_extras
ln -sv $(pwd)/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

i use arch btw
