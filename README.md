# dotfiles
My personal configuration files (.bashrc, .vimrc, git)

Everyone create little "systems" or ways of doing things, and programmers are the laziest kinds of people on Earth.
Typing up "clear" to clear the terminal? Nah, "c".

## install

Tailored to me but if you want..

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tu-nguyen/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

i use arch btw
