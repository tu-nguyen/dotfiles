# dotfiles
My personal configuration files for my personal laptop(.bashrc, .vimrc)

Everyone create little "systems" or ways of doing things, and programmers are the laziest kinds of people on Earth.
Typing up "clear" to clear the terminal? Nah, "c".

## install

Um these are kinda personal and VERy tailored to me but if you want...
I'm trying to make them worthwhile, that's the plan for 2021

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tu-nguyen/dotfiles.git
```

```sh
ln -sv <location>/dotfiles/<.??> ~
```

i use arch btw
